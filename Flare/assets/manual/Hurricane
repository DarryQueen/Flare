A hurricane is a type of tropical cyclone or severe tropical storm typically accompanied by thunderstorms, and in the Northern Hemisphere, a counterclockwise circulation of winds near the earth's surface.  The Atlantic hurricane season lasts from June to November, with the peak season from mid-August to late October. The Eastern Pacific hurricane season begins May 15 and ends November 30.

<BEFORE>
&#8226; Learn the elevation level of your property and whether the land is flood-prone. This will help you know how your property will be affected when storm surge or tidal flooding are forecasted. <br>
&#8226; Cover all of your home’s windows. Permanent storm shutters offer the best protection for windows. A second option is to board up windows with 5/8” marine plywood, cut to fit and ready to install. <br>
&#8226; Reinforce your garage doors; if wind enters a garage it can cause dangerous and expensive structural damage.<br>
&#8226; Plan to bring in all outdoor furniture, decorations, garbage cans and anything else that is not tied down.<br>
&#8226; If in a high-rise building, be prepared to take shelter on or below the 10th floor.<br>
</BEFORE>

<DURING>
&#8226; Secure your home, close storm shutters and secure outdoor objects or bring them indoors.<br>
&#8226; Turn off utilities if instructed to do so. Otherwise, turn the refrigerator thermostat to its coldest setting and keep its doors closed.  Turn off propane tanks. <br>
&#8226; Avoid using the phone, except for serious emergencies.<br>
&#8226; Stay indoors away from windows and glass doors.<br>
&#8226; Close all interior doors - secure and brace external doors.<br>
&#8226; Take refuge in a small interior room, closet or hallway on the lowest level.<br>
&#8226; Lie on the floor under a table or another sturdy object.<br>
&#8226; Keep curtains and blinds closed. Do not be fooled if there is a lull; it could be the eye of the storm – winds will pick up again.<br>
</DURING>

<AFTER>
&#8226; Stay alert for extended rainfall and subsequent flooding even after the hurricane or tropical storm has ended.<br>
&#8226; Keep away from loose or dangling power lines and report them immediately to the power company.<br>
&#8226; Stay out of any building if you smell gas, floodwaters remain around the building or your home was damaged by fire and the authorities have not declared it safe.<br>
&#8226; Wear protective clothing and be cautious when cleaning up to avoid injury.<br>
&#8226; NEVER use a generator inside homes, garages, crawlspaces, sheds, or similar areas, even when using fans or opening doors and windows for ventilation.<br>
