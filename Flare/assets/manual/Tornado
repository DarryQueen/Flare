<DESCRIP>
A tornado appears as a rotating, funnel&#8226;shaped cloud that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground with whirling winds that can reach 300 miles per hour. Damage paths can be in excess of one mile wide and 50 miles long. Every state is at some risk from this hazard. Before a tornado hits, the wind may die down and the air may become very still. A cloud of debris can mark the location of a tornado even if a funnel is not visible.  It is not uncommon to see clear, sunlit skies behind a tornado.

<BEFORE>
&#8226; Listen to NOAA Weather Radio or to commercial radio or television newscasts for the latest information. In any emergency, always listen to the instructions given by local emergency management officials. <br>
&#8226; Be alert to changing weather conditions. Look for approaching storms.<br>
&#8226; Look for the following danger signs:<br>
	<p>+ Dark, often greenish sky<br>
	<p>+ Large hail<br>
	<p>+ A large, dark, low-lying cloud (particularly if rotating)<br>
	<p>+ Loud roar, similar to a freight train.<br>
	<p>+ If you see approaching storms or any of the danger signs, be prepared to take shelter immediately.<br>
</BEFORE>

<DURING>
&#8226; Go to a pre-designated shelter area such as a safe room, basement, storm cellar, or the lowest building level. If there is no basement, go to the center of an interior room on the lowest level (closet, interior hallway) away from corners, windows, doors, and outside walls. Put as many walls as possible between you and the outside. Get under a sturdy table and use your arms to protect your head and neck.<br>
&#8226; In a high-rise building, go to a small interior room or hallway on the lowest floor possible.  Put on sturdy shoes and do not open windows.<br>
&#8226; In a trailer/mobile home, get out immediately and go to the lowest level of a nearby building or shelter<br>
&#8226; If outside, get into a vehicle and drive to the nearest sturdy shelter.  If you can safely get noticeably lower than the level of the roadway (not overpass or bridge), leave your car and lie in that area, covering your head with your hands.<br>
</DURING>

<AFTER>
&#8226; Wear sturdy shoes or boots, long sleeves and gloves when handling or walking on or near debris.  Beware of hazards from exposed nails and broken glass.<br>
&#8226; Do not touch downed power lines or objects in contact with downed lines. Report electrical hazards to the police and the utility company.<br>
&#8226; Never use generators, pressure washers, grills, camp stoves or other gasoline, propane, natural gas or charcoal-burning devices inside your home, basement, garage or camper or even outside near an open window, door or vent. <br>
&#8226; After a tornado, be aware of possible structural, electrical or gas-leak hazards in your home.  Shut off electrical power, natural gas and propane tanks to avoid fire, electrocution, or explosions<br>
