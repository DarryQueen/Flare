<DESCRIP>
Tsunamis are a series of fast-moving enormous waves created by an underwater disturbance such as an earthquake, landslide,volcanic eruption, or meteorite.  A tsunami can strike along most of the U.S. coastline. Areas are at greater risk if they are less than 25 feet above sea level and within a mile of the shoreline. Drowning is the most common cause of death associated with a tsunami.

<BEFORE>
&#8226; Create and practice an evacuation plan for your family. Familiarity may save your life. Be able to follow your escape route at night and during inclement weather. You should be able to reach your safe location on foot within 15 minutes. <br>
&#8226; Know the height of your street above sea level and the distance of your street from the coast or other high-risk waters. Evacuation orders may be based on these numbers.<br>
&#8226; If you are a tourist, familiarize yourself with local tsunami evacuation protocols. You may be able to safely evacuate to the third floor and higher in reinforced concrete hotel structures.<br>
&#8226; If an earthquake occurs and you are in a coastal area, turn on your radio to learn if there is a tsunami warning.<br>
</BEFORE>

<DURING>
&#8226; Follow the evacuation order issued by authorities and evacuate immediately. Take your animals with you.<br>
&#8226; Move inland to higher ground immediately. Pick areas 100 feet (30 meters) above sea level or go as far as 2 miles (3 kilometers) inland, away from the coastline. If you cannot get this high or far, go as high or far as you can. Every foot inland or upward may make a difference.<br>
&#8226; Stay away from the beach.  If there is noticeable recession in water away from the shoreline a tsunami is likely.  Move away immediately.<br>
</DURING>

<AFTER>
&#8226; A tsunami is a series of waves that may continue for hours. Do not assume that after one wave the danger is over. The next wave may be larger than the first one.<br>
&#8226; Avoid disaster areas. Your presence might interfere with emergency response operations and put you at further risk from the residual effects of floods.<br>
&#8226; Stay away from debris in the water; it may pose a safety hazard to people or pets.<br>
&#8226; Continue using a NOAA Weather Radio or tuning to a Coast Guard station or a local radio or television station for the latest updates.<br>
&#8226; Stay out of any building that has water around it and use caution when re-entering any buildings. Tsunami water can cause floors to crack or walls to collapse.<br>
&#8226; To avoid injury, wear protective clothing and be cautious when cleaning up.<br>
