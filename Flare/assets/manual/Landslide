<DESCRIP>
Landslides can be caused by earthquakes, storms, volcanic eruptions, and fire. In a landslide, masses of rock, earth or debris move down a slope. They can flow rapidly, striking with little or no warning at avalanche speeds. They also can travel several miles from their source, growing in size as they pick up trees, boulders, cars and other materials.

<BEFORE>
&#8226; Become familiar with the land around you. Learn whether debris flows have occurred in your area by contacting local officials. Slopes where debris flows have occurred in the past are likely to experience them in the future.<br>
&#8226; Get a ground assessment of your property.<br>
&#8226; Consult a professional for advice on appropriate preventative measures for your home or business, such as flexible pipe fittings, which can better resist breakage.<br>
&#8226; Protect your property by planting ground cover on slopes and building retaining walls.<br>
&#8226; In mudflow areas, build channels or deflection walls to direct the flow around buildings. Be aware, however, if you build walls to divert debris flow and the flow lands on a neighbor's property, you may be liable for damages.<br>
&#8226; If you are at risk from a landslide talk to your insurance agent. Debris flow may be covered by flood insurance policies from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).<br>
</BEFORE>

<DURING>
&#8226; During a severe storm, stay alert and awake. Many deaths from landslides occur while people are sleeping.<br>
&#8226; Listen to local news stations on a battery-powered radio for warnings of heavy rainfall.<br>
&#8226; Listen for unusual sounds that might indicate moving debris, such as trees cracking or boulders knocking together.<br>
&#8226; Move away from the path of a landslide or debris flow as quickly as possible. The danger from a mudflow increases near stream channels and with prolonged heavy rains. Mudflows can move faster than you can walk or run. Look upstream before crossing a bridge and do not cross the bridge if a mudflow is approaching.<br>
&#8226; Avoid river valleys and low-lying areas.<br>
&#8226; If you are near a stream or channel, be alert for any sudden increase or decrease in water flow and notice whether the water changes from clear to muddy. Such changes may mean there is debris flow activity upstream so be prepared to move quickly.<br>
&#8226; Curl into a tight ball and protect your head if escape is not possible.<br>
</DURING>

<AFTER>
&#8226; Stay away from the slide area. There may be danger of additional slides.<br>
&#8226; Watch for flooding, which may occur after a landslide or debris flow. Floods sometimes follow landslides and debris flows because they may both be started by the same event.<br>
&#8226; Look for and report broken utility lines and damaged roadways and railways to appropriate authorities. Reporting potential hazards will get the utilities turned off as quickly as possible, preventing further hazard and injury.<br>
&#8226; Check the building foundation, chimney, and surrounding land for damage. Damage to foundations, chimneys, or surrounding land may help you assess the safety of the area.<br>
&#8226; Replant damaged ground as soon as possible since erosion caused by loss of ground cover can lead to flash flooding and additional landslides in the near future.<br>
