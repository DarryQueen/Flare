<DESCRIP>
When pressure from gases within the molten rock of a mountain becomes too great, an eruption (quiet or explosive) occurs.  There may be lava flows, flattened landscapes, poisonous gases, and flying rock and ash that can sometimes travel hundreds of miles downwind.  Because of their intense heat, lava flows are great fire hazards.  Volcanic eruptions can be accompanied by other natural hazards, including earthquakes, mudflows and flash floods, rock falls andlandslides, acid rain, fire, and (under special conditions) tsunamis.  The danger area around a volcano covers approximately a 20-mile radius however some danger may exist 100 miles or more from a volcano.

<BEFORE>
&#8226; Build an Emergency Supply Kit, which includes items like non-perishable food, water, a battery-powered or hand-crank radio, extra flashlights and batteries. You may want to prepare a portable kit and keep it in your car in case you are told to evacuate. This kit should also include a pair of goggles and disposable breathing masks for each member of the family. <br>
&#8226; Make a Family Emergency Plan. Your family may not be together when disaster strikes, so it is important to know how you will contact one another, how you will get back together and what you will do in case of an emergency.<br>
</BEFORE>

<DURING>
&#8226; Follow the evacuation order issued by authorities and evacuate immediately from the volcano area to avoid flying debris, hot gases, lateral blast and lava flow.<br>
&#8226; Be aware of mudflows. The danger from a mudflow increases near stream channels and with prolonged heavy rains. Mudflows can move faster than you can walk or run. Look upstream before crossing a bridge and do not cross the bridge if a mudflow is approaching.<br>
&#8226; Avoid river valleys and low-lying areas.<br>
&#8226; Remember to help your neighbors who may require special assistance-infants, elderly people and people with access and functional needs.<br>
</DURING>

<AFTER>
&#8226; Go to a designated public shelter if you have been told to evacuate or you feel it is unsafe to remain in your home. Text SHELTER + your ZIP code to 43362 (4FEMA) to find the nearest shelter in your area (example: shelter 12345).<br>
&#8226; Local authorities may not immediately be able to provide information on what is happening and what you should do. However, you should listen to NOAA Weather Radio, watch TV, listen to the radio or check the Internet often for official news and instructions as they become available.<br>
