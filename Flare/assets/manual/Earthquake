<DESCRIP>
An earthquake is the sudden, rapid shaking of the earth, caused by the breaking and shifting of subterranean rock as it releases strain that has accumulated over a long time.  If the earthquake occurs in a populated area, it may cause many deaths and injuries and extensive property damage.  All 50 states and 5 U.S. territories are at some risk for earthquakes at any time of the year.

<BEFORE>
&#8226; Fasten shelves securely to walls.<br>
&#8226; Place large or heavy objects on lower shelves.<br>
&#8226; Store breakable items such as bottled foods, glass, and china in low, closed cabinets with latches.<br>
&#8226; Fasten heavy items such as pictures and mirrors securely to walls and away from beds, couches and anywhere people sit.<br>
&#8226; Brace overhead light fixtures and top heavy objects.<br>
&#8226; Secure your water heater, refrigerator, furnace and gas appliances by strapping them to the wall studs and bolting to the floor. If recommended by your gas company, have an automatic gas shut-off valve installed that is triggered by strong vibrations.<br>
&#8226; Store weed killers, pesticides, and flammable products securely in closed cabinets with latches and on bottom shelves.<br>
&#8226; Locate safe spots in each room under a sturdy table or against an inside wall.<br>
</BEFORE>

<DURING>
&#8226; If indoors, DROP to the ground; take COVER by getting under a sturdy table or other piece of furniture; and HOLD ON until the shaking stops. Cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building.<br>
&#8226; Stay away from glass, windows, outside doors and walls, and anything that could fall, such as lighting fixtures or furniture.<br>
&#8226; If outdoors, stay outdoors until the shaking stops and move away from buildings, streetlights, and utility wires.<br>
&#8226; If in a moving vehicle, stop as quickly as safety permits and stay in the vehicle. Avoid stopping near or under buildings, trees, overpasses, and utility wires.<br>
&#8226; If trapped under debris, do not light a match or kick up dust.  Cover your mouth with a handkerchief or clothing.<br>
&#8226; Tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can locate you. Use a whistle if one is available. Shout only as a last resort. Shouting can cause you to inhale dangerous amounts of dust.<br>
</DURING>

<AFTER>
&#8226; Expect aftershocks up to days or weeks after the quake.<br>
&#8226; Look for and extinguish small fires. Fire is the most common hazard after an earthquake.  Inspect the entire length of chimneys for damage. Unnoticed damage could lead to a fire.<br>
&#8226; Be aware of possible tsunamis if you live in coastal areas and stay away from the beach.<br>
&#8226; Be careful when driving after an earthquake and anticipate traffic light outages.<br>
&#8226; Put on long pants, a long-sleeved shirt, sturdy shoes and work gloves to protect against injury from broken objects.<br>
&#8226; Clean up spilled medicines, bleaches, gasoline or other flammable liquids immediately. Leave the area if you smell gas or fumes from other chemicals.<br>
&#8226; Check for gas leaks, turn off electricity at main fuse box or circuit breaker, check for sewage and water line damage.<br>
