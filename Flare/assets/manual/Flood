<DESCRIP>
Floods are one of the most common hazards in the United States.  Flash floods can occur within a few minutes or hours of excessive rainfall, a dam or levee failure, or a sudden release of water held by an ice jam. Flash floods often have a dangerous wall of roaring water carrying rocks, mud and other debris. Overland flooding, the most common type of flooding event typically occurs when waterways such as rivers or streams overflow their banks as a result of rainwater or a possible levee breach and cause flooding in surrounding areas.

<BEFORE>
&#8226; Avoid building in a floodplain unless you elevate and reinforce your home. <br>
&#8226; Elevate the furnace, water heater and electric panel in your home if you live in an area that has a high flood risk.<br>
&#8226; Consider installing "check valves" to prevent flood water from backing up into the drains of your home.<br>
&#8226; If feasible, construct barriers to stop floodwater from entering the building and seal walls in basements with waterproofing compounds.<br>
</BEFORE>

<DURING>
&#8226; Be aware that flash flooding can occur. If there is any possibility of a flash flood, move immediately to higher ground. Do not wait for instructions to move.<br>
&#8226; Be aware of stream, drainage channels, canyons and other areas known to flood suddenly. Flash floods can occur in these areas with or without typical warnings such as rain clouds or heavy rain.<br>
&#8226; If evacuating, secure your home. If you have time, bring in outdoor furniture. Move essential items to an upper floor.<br>
&#8226; Turn off utilities at the main switches or valves if instructed to do so. Disconnect electrical appliances. Do not touch electrical equipment if you are wet or standing in water.<br>
&#8226; Do not walk through moving water. Six inches of moving water can make you fall. If you have to walk in water, walk where the water is not moving. Use a stick to check the firmness of the ground in front of you.<br>
&#8226; Do not drive into flooded areas. If floodwaters rise around your car, abandon the car and move to higher ground if you can do so safely. You and the vehicle can be swept away quickly.<br>
&#8226; Do not camp or park your vehicle along streams, rivers or creeks, particularly during threatening conditions.
</DURING>

<AFTER>
&#8226; Avoid moving water.<br>
&#8226; Play it safe. Additional flooding or flash floods can occur. Listen for local warnings and information. If your car stalls in rapidly rising waters, get out immediately and climb to higher ground.<br>
&#8226; If you must walk or drive in areas that have been flooded, stay on firm, familiar ground.<br>
&#8226; Be aware of areas where floodwaters have receded. Roads may have weakened and could collapse under the weight of a car.<br>
&#8226; Stay out of any building if it is surrounded by floodwaters.<br>
&#8226; Use extreme caution when entering buildings; there may be hidden damage, particularly in foundations.<br>
&#8226; Turn off the electricity at the main breaker or fuse box, even if the power is off in your community. That way, you can decide when your home is dry enough to turn it back on.<br>
